Certainly! Here's the code explained in Markdown format, which can be used as a README.md file:

# Aquaponics System Control

This is a Python script that sets up a web application for controlling an aquaponics system. The application allows users to toggle the state of components (water pump, air pump, and light) and set system parameters (water level, temperature, and pH level) through a web interface.

## Dependencies

- microdot
- pandas

You can install the dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
pip install microdot pandas
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or download the script file to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have a valid `state.csv` file in the same directory as the script. The CSV file should have the following columns: `water_pump`, `air_pump`, `light`, `water_level`, `temperature`, `pH_level`.

3. Run the script using Python:

```shell
python aquaponics_control.py
```

4. Access the web application by opening a web browser and visiting `http://localhost:8008`.

## Usage

The web application provides the following functionality:

- **Toggle Components**: Click on the buttons to toggle the state of the components (water pump, air pump, and light). The state changes will be reflected in the HTML document generated by the server.

- **Set Parameters**: You can set the system parameters (water level, temperature, and pH level) by appending the appropriate values to the URL. For example, to set the water level to 5, visit `http://localhost:8008/set_parameter/water_level/5`.

- **View System Status**: The HTML document generated by the server displays the current system status, including the state of the components and the system parameters.

## File Structure

- `aquaponics_control.py`: The main Python script that sets up the web application and defines the routes and handlers.

- `state.csv`: The CSV file used to store the system state.
